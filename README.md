# Archive

> Archived projects that never made it to production — but shaped how I build today.

This repo serves as a digital memorial for side projects, prototypes, and experiments that were paused, pivoted, or gracefully abandoned.

## 📁 Structure

- `Ideas/` – Sketches, architecture notes, and napkin-level concepts.
- `Notes/` – Thoughts and snippets that didn’t yet evolve into anything else.
- `Projects/` – Substantial development efforts that were ultimately shelved.
- `Prototypes/` – Quick POCs or playgrounds used to test ideas or technologies.

More will rest here in peace...  
each with a story, a purpose, and a lesson left behind.
